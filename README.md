# 
# Preparation
1. Download this repo (green button -> download as zip)
2. Disable SIP
3. open terminal, and type "sudo mount -uw /", (this is you can edit the system files) it will ask you to enter your admin password, please note, when you type it in, the letters won't appear. 
4. Download macOSLucidaGrande (at the time of writing, it's not available for macOS Catalina): https://github.com/LumingYin/macOSLucidaGrande/releases
5. Download LiteIcon: https://freemacsoft.net/liteicon/

# Installation
Backing up important data, this is really really important!
1. Copy these two files: SystemAppearance.car and Assets.car from "/System/Library/CoreServices/SystemAppearance.bundle/Contents/Resources/" two somewhere you won't lose them
Installing the theme
1. Copy the files SystemAppearance.car Assets.car from this repo (you downloaded it earlier) to "/System/Library/CoreServices/SystemAppearance.bundle/Contents/Resources/" (replace the existing ones)
2. now comes the annoying part, replacing the icons, in this repo there are all .icns files (.icns) that I was able to find,
   open LiteIcon and drag the correct .icns from this repo to the coresponding one in LiteIcon, no worries, LiteIcon can reset them
   later easily.
 
If there are any problems, don't hesitate to ask me
